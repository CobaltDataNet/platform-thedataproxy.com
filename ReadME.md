The backend is hosted at `api.thedataproxy.com`, and the frontend is available at [Icon Luxury Group Dashboard](https://dashboard.thedataproxy.com).

## Forking the Repository üç¥

You can fork the repository using either the GitHub CLI or the GitHub API.

### Using GitHub CLI

1. **Install GitHub CLI**  
   If you haven't installed it yet:
   - **macOS (Homebrew):**
     ```bash
     brew install gh
     ```
   - **Windows & Linux:**  
     Follow the [GitHub CLI installation guide](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation).

2. **Authenticate with GitHub:**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in to your GitHub account.

3. **Fork the Repository:**
   ```bash
   gh repo fork OWNER/REPO --clone
   ```
   Replace `OWNER/REPO` with the repository's owner and name (e.g., `octocat/Hello-World`). The `--clone` flag automatically clones your fork.

### Using the GitHub API with curl

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
   export OWNER=repository_owner
   export REPO=repository_name
   ```

2. **Fork the Repository:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/${OWNER}/${REPO}/forks
   ```
   This sends a POST request to fork the repository into your account.

---

## Creating a Feature Branch üåø

Once you have your fork cloned locally, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

This keeps your changes organized and separate from the main branch.

---

## Making Your Changes ‚ú®

Work on your feature or bug fix in your new branch. Follow the project's coding standards and best practices, and remember to comment your code for clarity.

---

## Committing and Pushing Changes üíæ

1. **Commit Your Changes:**  
   Use descriptive commit messages to explain your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature X to improve Y"
   ```

2. **Push Your Changes:**  
   Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

---

## Opening a Pull Request üîÄ

After pushing your changes:

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. Click the **"Compare & pull request"** button.
3. Provide a clear description of your changes and reference any related issues.
4. Submit your pull request to the main repository for review.
